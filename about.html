            We are a group of students wanting to create a basic website used both by educational institutions, but also by individuals who wish to learn code.
            <br><br>
            Not everyone has the means to learn code either from the way they grew up, to their financial situation. So to encourage more people getting into what they love
            We will offer a website such that they have the ability to learn at their own pace if they want. Or to learn from someone and shadow that person who is giving them assignments.
