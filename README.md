# CS 1530 Group Project
By: Ethan Whittaker, Elijah Morgan, & Kendall Foy

## Setup
- First, download and clone the code from this repository.
- Before making any changes, make sure that you are on your own local branch and not on our primary branch (develop) as the branch policies dictate you cannot directly push to develop without any peer reviews (PRs)
- The best option is to use Visual Studio Code, so if you do not have this IDE, please download it
- Next make sure you install the correct extension
  - Open In Browser by TechER
