## Setup
- First, download and clone the code from this repository.
- The best option is to use Visual Studio Code, so if you do not have this IDE, please download it as in later steps we depend on extensions in the Visual Studio Code library to run this website
- Next make sure you install the correct extension
  - Live Server by Ritwick Dey

## Running
*If the extension has been downloaded and setup as explained above, you should be able to do these steps*
- In your explorer tab on the left of your VSCode screen, where the code you should have cloned and setup in a local directory, navigate to home.html

## Alternate Running Steps
*If you are having problems with the running steps above, you can try this instead*
- You still need to follow the two steps in Setup above, by doing these two if you haven't already
  - First, download and clone the code from this repository.
  - The best option is to use Visual Studio Code, so if you do not have this IDE, please download it as in later steps we depend on extensions in the Visual Studio Code library to run this website
- But instead of downloading the Live Server Extension, you can download the "Open in Browser" extension by TechER

- Then to run, navigate to the explorer tab and find `home.html`, DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
- Right-click `home.html` and at the very bottom there should be an option to "Open in Default Browser", left-click that
